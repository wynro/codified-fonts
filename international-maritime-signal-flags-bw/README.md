# International Maritime Signal Flag (BW)

This font adapts the [International Maritime Signal Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags) alphabet, used mainly in naval communications.

This font is in black and white<!-- Because I still don't know how to do colorized fonts -->, that means not all the glyphs are exactly like their naval equivalent, in an effort to create unique and distinguishable characters. The colors are not converted in a one to one manner, each glyph is converted semi-independently to be aesthetically appealing, while maintaining uniqueness. For example, in **D** and **K** the color yellow is converted to black, but in **I** and **Q** its converted to white.

I have also included other characters not in the IMSF, to prevent errors loading the font (like the `period` or the `space`)

The numbers are not included, because some of them would be impossible to create in a black and white palette, considering each glyph must be easily distinguishable. Examples of this are the numbers 1, 2 and 3; and the numbers 7, 8 and 9. <!-- Maybe I could use the ICS flags, instead of the NATO ones -->
