# Fonts

All the fonts in this repository created by me (that's it, all the fonts that are not in `original/`, or whose glyphs are not based in **Carlito**) are licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), unless explicitly stated. I don't apply a license to the fonts derived from **Carlito**, because they are just transpositions of **Carlito** itself.

The fonts currently derived from **Carlito** are `atbash` and `caesar`.

# Code

All the code in this repository is licensed under the GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated.
